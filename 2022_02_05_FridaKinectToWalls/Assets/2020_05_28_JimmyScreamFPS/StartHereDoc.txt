Hello and welcome.

This package is just a drag and drop prefab (gameobject & canvas version) that allows you to check that your game is over 60fps.
It can be a bit configurated in Jimmy Screamer script.

But the idea is that between 60-42 FPS a first audio is trigger and the volume is going up.
Between 40 and 2 FPS you can set up an annoying sound because you game should never be under 40 fps.

Feel free to download your own sound and replace the default one.

I am contactable on Discord and Github:

Hope your enjoy the tool.

Kind regards,
